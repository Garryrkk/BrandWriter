TECHNICAL WRITING RULES

Use examples even for advanced content.

Define a concept once, not twice.

Add lightweight analogies (“Think of it like…”).

Use simple math notation when explaining ML workflows.

Explain trade-offs: accuracy vs. speed, compute vs. iteration.

Provide actionable defaults (baselines, hyperparameters).

THE GenJecX EDITING CHECKLIST

Before any content is final, ask:

Is every sentence necessary?

Does each line push the narrative forward?

Is the hook strong?

Is jargon replaced by clarity?

Are there at least 2 examples or insights?

Are paragraphs short?

Is the CTA meaningful?

If any answer is “no,” revise.

BRAND “WHY THIS MATTERS” STATEMENTS

Use these often:

“Speed compounds.”

“Clarity aligns teams.”

“Good communication prevents expensive mistakes.”

“Iteration loops turn guesswork into progress.”

“Your content should work as hard as your code.”
